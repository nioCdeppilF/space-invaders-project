SpaceInvadersMenu(v10).py - This code initializes and displays a game menu with options to start the game or exit, and it also displays the high score. When the start button is clicked, it runs the spaceInvaders.py file, and when the exit button is clicked, it stops the frame animation.

SpaceInvadersV10.py - This code initializes the space invaders game that we made. It allows the player to play as a spaceship sprite and go against the alien sprites, scoring points in the process. At the end of each game, the score is stored into the scores.txt and the highest score in the file will be displayed in main menu (SpaceInvadersMenu(v10).py). It also opens all sprites from the github we used to upload all our work on - https://github.com/nioCdeppilF/space-invaders-project. Once the game is over, after about 5 seconds, it'll take the user back to the SpaceInvadersMenu(v10).py where they can play again if they wish to or close the game.

scores.txt - Holds all the scores the user gets in the game to display the high score in the SpaceInvadersMenu(v10).py canvas
