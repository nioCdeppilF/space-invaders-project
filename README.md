menu.py - This code initializes and displays a game menu with options to start the game or exit, and it also displays the high score. When the start button is clicked, it runs the spaceInvaders.py file, and when the exit button is clicked, it stops the frame animation.

spaceInvaders.py - This code initializes the space invaders game we have made. It allows the player to play as a sprite spaceship and go against the alien sprites, scoring points in the process. At the end of each game, the score is stroed into the scores.txt to be displayed in menu.py. It also opens all sprites from the github we used to upload all our work on - https://github.com/nioCdeppilF/space-invaders-project. Once the game is over it takes the user back to the menu.py so they can play again if they wish or leave the game.

scores.txt - Holds all the scores the user gets in the game to display the high score in the menu.py canvas
